# BioDC 
## A Python program that automates and accelerates the computation of redox conductiviity in polymeric multi-heme cytochromes 

### What does this project do?

BioDC computes the diffusive redox current in polymeric multi-heme cytochrome 'nanowires.' To do that, the energetics for each heme-to-heme electron transfer are estimated from the heme solvent accessibility and stacking geometry, as well as the redox-linked change in electrostatic energy. Standard Marcus-theory rates are computed and used to determine a single-particle diffusion coefficient along a one-dimensional chain of ('hopping') sites with the analytical Derrida formula. The diffusion coefficient is proportional to electrical resistance, thus allowing Ohmic redox current to be computed.
